**[7. Design Decisions]**  
- We chose a soft light grey background to reduce glare and eye strain.  
- Cards and forms use subtle shadows and rounded corners for a modern, friendly look.  
- Color-coded badges make priorities and categories easy to spot.  
- Notifications provide instant feedback for all actions.  
- All data is saved locally, so your tasks persist without needing an account.
